# Data Science Course

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of projects I've developed while learning Python programming and various data science concepts. The collection encapsulates my ongoing commitment to continuous learning and the practical utilization of programming skills in diverse, real-world scenarios.

## Overview of Projects

In order to maintain a structured and systematic approach to my project, I have organized the files by week and day, reflecting a clear progression of tasks and milestones. In each week is a markdown file with the concepts and assignments along with a quiz for an assessment of the topics learned.

A few people have reached out to my friend Troy regarding getting access to the learning outline/curriculum we developed using ChatGPT 4.0. For easy access, I've uploaded the learning outlines in one zip file "DataScience_learning_outline.zip". Please note that many of the video links are not working. In those cases, I searched for other videos explaining the concept described.

## Getting Started

To run these applications, download the projects and navigate to the directory containing setup.py. Run "pip install -e ."

## Acknowledgments

The curriculum and quizzes were generated using ChatGPT 4.0 with the help of my friend Troy. The projects were created with assistance from Troy and Brandon. Thanks Troy and Brandon!

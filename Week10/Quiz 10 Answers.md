#### Short Answer

6. Backpropagation is the algorithm used for minimizing the error in the neural network's predictions. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule.

7. Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width & height) of the input volume. They are used to decrease the computational complexity and to provide a form of translation invariance.

8. LSTMs have a more complex structure with three gates (input, output, forget), while GRUs simplify this with two gates (reset, update). LSTMs are more parameter-heavy, whereas GRUs are computationally more efficient.

9. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for a different but related task. It is advantageous because it saves training time and requires less labeled data for the new task.

10. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the weights of a pre-trained model to make it more suited for the new task. It is crucial when the new task is significantly different but related to the task the model was initially trained on.

#### Short Answer

6. Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at a regular time interval. It is significant for understanding the underlying structure and pattern in temporal data for forecasting.

7. Moving averages are used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in data. They are calculated by taking the average of a set number of periods.

8. An autoregressive model uses the relationship between an observation and its previous observations (lags) to predict future values. The architecture is defined by the order `p`, which indicates the number of lags used.

9. State space models are a class of mathematical models that allow for the representation of time series data in a form that accommodates both uncertainties in the observations and the underlying process. They are used for filtering, smoothing, and forecasting.

10. Cross-validation is crucial for assessing the predictive performance of time series models and for choosing the model that performs best in making future predictions.

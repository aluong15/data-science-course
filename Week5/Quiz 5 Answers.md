    6.  A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types.
    
    7.  The `groupby` method in Pandas is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria and then apply a function to each group independently. It is useful for data aggregation and summarization.
    
    8.  Interactive plots allow users to engage with the data more effectively, enabling zoom, pan, and update functionalities, thereby providing deeper insights into the data.
    
    9.  Data transformation in Pandas involves changing the structure or values in a DataFrame, such as converting data types, normalizing values, or mapping values from one set to another.
    
    10.  Pandas can be integrated with Matplotlib by using the `DataFrame.plot()` method, which provides a convenient way to plot DataFrame data using Matplotlib as the backend.

    #### Short Answer
    
    6.  A self-join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. Use-cases include finding pairs, hierarchical data, and network analysis.
    
    7.  A CTE is a named temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Unlike subqueries, CTEs can be referenced multiple times in the main query.
    
    8.  Window functions perform a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row within the same result set. They are useful for tasks like running totals or moving averages.
    
    9.  SQL can be integrated with Python using libraries like `sqlite3` for SQLite databases or `SQLAlchemy` for more complex relational databases. Data can be fetched into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis.
    
    10.  The integration allows for a seamless workflow from data extraction to transformation and finally visualization. It leverages the strengths of each tool, providing a powerful, flexible, and efficient data analysis pipeline.
    
    #### Code Snippet
    
    11.  Answers may vary but should perform a FULL JOIN on tables `A` and `B` based on the `id` column.
    
    12.  Answers may vary but should use a CTE to find the average salary from the `salaries` table.
    
    13.  Answers may vary but should use SQLAlchemy to query the `employees` table and fetch the `name` and `salary` columns.
    
    14.  Answers may vary but should fetch data into a Pandas DataFrame and filter rows based on salary.
    
    15.  Answers may vary but should use Matplotlib to plot a bar chart of the top 5 highest salaries.

5. B

#### Short Answer

6. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and fluctuations, which makes it perform poorly on unseen data.

7. Feature scaling is crucial for algorithms that rely on distances or gradients, as it ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's performance.

8. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets and performing 'k' training and testing iterations. It provides a more robust performance estimate compared to a simple train-test split.

9. Hyperparameter tuning involves optimizing the settings that impact the model's performance to improve its predictive accuracy.

10. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to create a more robust and accurate model. They can reduce overfitting, improve accuracy, and enhance the model's predictive performance.
